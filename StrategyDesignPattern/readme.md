The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern used in object-oriented programming to define a family of algorithms, 
encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. The key idea is to separate the algorithm from the object that uses it, 
allowing the algorithm to vary independently from the client that uses it.
Key Concepts of the Strategy Pattern

    Context: This is the object that contains a reference to a strategy object and is used by the client. 
    It delegates the algorithmic behavior to the strategy object.

    Strategy Interface: This defines a common interface for all algorithms (strategies). 
    The context class uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by a concrete strategy.

    Concrete Strategies: These are the implementations of the strategy interface. Each concrete strategy implements a specific algorithm.

Benefits of the Strategy Pattern

    Flexibility: Algorithms can be changed at runtime by switching between different concrete strategies.
    Code Reusability: You can define multiple strategies for different use cases without changing the client code.
    Encapsulation: Each algorithm is encapsulated in its own class, so it's easy to understand and maintain.

When to Use the Strategy Pattern

    You have multiple related algorithms or behaviors.
    You want to avoid conditional statements for choosing behaviors (such as if-else or switch).
    You need to swap algorithms at runtime dynamically.
    You want to isolate specific algorithms in their own classes for easier modification and extension

Explanation of the Example

    The PaymentStrategy interface declares a method pay(int amount) that is implemented by different concrete classes: CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, and BitcoinPayment.
    The ShoppingCart class (the context) interacts with the PaymentStrategy but does not need to know the specifics of the algorithm; it simply uses the strategy that is set at runtime.
    The client (Main class) sets the payment strategy dynamically, demonstrating how easy it is to swap strategies without changing the logic of the ShoppingCart.

Benefits of Using Strategy Pattern in This Example

    The payment methods are separated into individual classes, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.
    It avoids complex if-else or switch logic for handling different payment methods.
    New payment methods can easily be added without modifying existing code, following the Open-Closed Principle.

Summary

The Strategy Pattern helps in defining multiple algorithms for a task and allows these algorithms to be interchangeable. This pattern makes the system flexible, modular, and easy to extend without modifying the existing code.
